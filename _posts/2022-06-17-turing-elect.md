Over the past 3 years, we’ve been working hard to help you build Bayes better, and we’re proud to be the PPL of choice for both experts and researchers [just starting to learn](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia/) Bayesian statistics. This broad appeal is a testament to Turing’s excellent design, which makes expressing complex models effortless.

As part of this project to help scientists understand their data better, TuringLang is looking to branch out into public outreach. Our goal is to help inform everyone (regardless of their statistical background) on the principles of statistical inference, by providing examples of high-quality statistical modeling.

As a result, we’re proud to announce TuringElect, a new project to build Bayesian forecasts for the 2022 midterms. As part of this project, we’ll be building: 
- Election forecasts taking advantage of the newest innovations in political science and statistical modeling
- Intuitive explanations of how our model works for lay audiences
- Interactive web applications to help users understand how our model works
- Graphics with easy-to-understand depictions of possible election results

The end product should be similar to those put out by [The Economist](https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president) or [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/).

By helping to raise awareness of the importance and advantages of good statistical modeling, we hope to improve public support and recognition for the open-source software you all know and love. We also expect this project to produce tangible benefits for our users, such as examples of complex Bayesian time-series models and tutorials on using priors to combine information from many different sources. Thanks to everyone for your support!
