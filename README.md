This repository contains the source code for the new Turing.jl website, which contains the documentation, tutorials, news, contribution guide, etc...

#### To get started with the Turing.jl website locally, you'll need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Quarto Pre-release](https://quarto.org/docs/download/)

Once you have these prerequisites installed, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    https://github.com/TuringLang/turing-test-website.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the cloned directory:

    ```bash
    cd turing-test-website
    ```

3. Preview the website using Quarto Preview:
